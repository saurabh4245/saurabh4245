## 📝  **Top Kaggle Notebooks**

### [1️⃣ Healthy Fast Foods: KMeans and Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vijay20213/healthy-fast-foods-kmeans-and-visualization)  
> **Description:**  
> In this project, I explored **healthy fast foods** and clustered them into three groups based on calorie count. Using these clusters, I identified the healthiest fast food category. This will help people avoid harmful fast foods.  
> **Achievements:** Bronze Medal 🏅 | 4,604 Views  📊

### [2️⃣ Cancer Prediction with 98% Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vijay20213/cancer-prediction-with-98-accuracy)  
> **Description:**  
> This project focuses on **image processing** and the construction of a **CNN model** to predict cancer with 98% accuracy. I also analyzed the model’s performance metrics.  
> **Achievements:** Bronze Medal 🏅 | 1,621 Views 📊  

### [3️⃣ Pneumonia Detection with CNN and ML with 98% Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vijay20213/pneumonia-detection-with-cnn-and-ml-with-98-acc)  
> **Description:**  
> I trained a **CNN model** using **17,000 X-ray images** to build a model for pneumonia detection. The project includes a website for easy interaction with the model.  
> **Achievements:** Bronze Medal 🏅 | 2,000 Views 📊  

### [4️⃣ Stress Identification: NLP with Best Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vijay20213/stress-identification-nlp-with-best-prediction)  
> **Description:**  
> This **NLP** project covers the entire process from **EDA**, **text processing**, **regex operations**, **TF-IDF**, and **BOW** to **model training**.  
> **Achievements:** Bronze Medal 🏅 | 2,710 Views 📊  

### [5️⃣ Activity Monitoring System Prediction - EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vijay20213/activity-monitoring-system-prediction-eda)  
> **Description:**  
> This project involves handling an **imbalanced dataset** for activity prediction. I explored techniques like **undersampling**, **oversampling**, and **synthetic minorities**. However, due to the low data for labels like **stair descending** and **stair ascending**, I avoided these techniques to prevent data loss and overfitting. The model is suitable for **elder activity tracking**, potentially deployable on hardware like **Raspberry Pi**.  
> **Suggestions:** Try the imbalance handling techniques mentioned in my notebook and share your results in the comments.  
> **Achievements:** Bronze Medal 🏅 | 680 Views 📊
